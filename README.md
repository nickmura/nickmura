### Hello everyone! 


My name is Nick Mura, and I am an aspiring software developer, and cryptography nerd from Edmonton, Canada. My interests are developing and scaling projects, cryptography systems, and jumping head first into new technologies and skillsets.

- 🔭 My main project I am currently working full time on is **[trxmini.games](http://github.com/nickmura/trxmini.games/)** which is a wagering platform for minigames and eSports titles on TRON and soon to be BTTC. Soon, I will be posting articles and blogposts on my site **[nickmura.ca](https://nickmura.ca)**

- 🐇 I am soon going to be learning C & Rust to excell my expertise in systems programming, and possibly AI soon!

- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything that would interest me (feel free to message or mention me on [Twitter, @nickmura2](https://twitter.com/nickmura2)) but specifically if you are working on anything related to functional programming (Haskell, Lisp, etc), or smart contract development in languages other than Solidity! (solidity is cool too)

- 🤔 Ask me anything about crypto, blockchain, AI, functional programming, music, or anything related to programming.

- 💬 You can reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickmura/) or at my email dev@nickmura.ca
